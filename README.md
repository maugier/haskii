# Haskii

A monadic library for drawing ascii art and colorful interfaces.

Unlike typical curses-like libraries, Haskii is focused on pure code,
and abstract rendeding of 2d content.

It works with Strings, Text, ByteStrings, and Chunks from the rainbow[1]
library.

Check the haddock docs for examples.
